    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",

    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "Write your answer to the question in this box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who invented Python and why: Invented by Guido van Rossum \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "os: Van Rossum worked on the Amoeba project from 1986 till 1991 (https://gvanrossum.github.io/Resume.html) at CWI (define). The goal of the Amoeba project was 'to construct an operating system for networks of computers that would present the network to the user as if it were a single machine'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily the C programming language was used to develop Amoeba's system administration utilities however this was taking too long. The available user interface to access these utilities (Bourne shell) could not be used. This is because the Bourne shell could not access Amoeba's system call interface due to a difference in the primitive operations of the Bourne shell and the Amoeba os. Python was created as an answer to these two problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/personal-history-part-1-cwi.html\n",
    "\n",
    "What was the language designed to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is influenced by a programming language titled 'ABC' which Van Rossum had worked with for 4 years. Where ABC fell short, Van Rossum wanted to improve upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is ABC then?\n",
    "\n",
    "https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to be extensible. Developers and users could add some of their own features and functionality unlike the strict ABC language. The idea for Python was to have a standard library and a set of built-in object types (e.g. Dictionaries, strings e.t.c) but for Python's environment to be able to evolve dependent on what is required. For example, it was very difficult to introduce tools to open and extract information from files in ABC but in Python this could be done by the addition of such tools to Python's standard library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response to the Amoeba OS issue raised above, the extensible nature of Python allowed tools to be created so that Python could interact with Amoeba's system calls. Naturally this also meant that Python could be configured with other operating systems by introducing any required functionality in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was also designed to handle exceptions. While working on the Amoeba OS, Van Rossum realised the importance of handling errors. Instead of a program terminating due to an exception error, it can be responded to with user specified code. This is done by the use of 'try' and 'except' in Python.\n",

    "- easily extensible interpreter stemmed from frustrations with ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "Origin of the name python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum took a liking to the comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and was a big fan. He thought titling the language as \"Python\" would be best since it was 'catchy, a bit edgy, and fit in the tradition of naming languages after famous people'.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) \n",
    "\n",
    "Is the language a compiled language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a language is compiled or intepreted is a question about the languages implementations. An implementation of a programming language is a system for executing computer programs.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation)  The implementation compiles the source code of a program (e.g a file with extention \".py\" for Python) into an intermediate. The intermediate is then interpreted by an interpreter and an output is returned (commonly seen at the user interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations that compile the source code of a program into native machine code as the intermediate are called \"compilers\". This is true of programs written in C that are compiled into native machine code and an executable is returned. This machine code can then be interpreted by a computer processing unit (CPU) and an output returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations that compile the source code into an intermediate (a common type for python programs is \"byte code\") that is interpretted line by line are called \"interpreters\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Since most of Pythons implementations are \"interpreters\" and as stated in the languages documentation, it is called an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there is an implementation of Python (e.g Nuitka http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html) that returns an executable as an intermediate. In this case, this implementation of Python is a \"compiler\".\n",

The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

    "NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is an open source python library that provides matrices and multidimensional arrays alongside high level tools for the demands of \"low level\" scientific computing (ref https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy#Traits). Some of these tools include: mathematical and statistical operations, array shape manipulation, subsetting and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays and functions can be represented using standard python objects however the utility of the NumPy package is its performance speed. This speed is a result of two concepts: \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization: element wise computations (e.g the scalar product of two numeric vectors) would require the use of loops if standard Python objects are used e.g. lists. NumPy avoids this explicit looping aspect and performs element wise computations simultaneously.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Broadcasting: NumPy implicitly performs computations element wise. For example arithmetic operations between two numeric vectors of the same shape is done component wise without any explicit user intervention.  However for two Numpy arrays that differ in shape, subject to certain conditions the smaller array is (as a concept) extended to have the same shape as the 'bigger' array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both these features of NumPy result in code that looks cleaner and in some cases faster.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib  is a plotting library in Python that provides the tools to produce 2d/3d data visualizations across different platforms. It initially emulated the production of graphics in MATLAB however it is independent of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot options include but are not limited to bar charts, histograms, scatterplots and boxplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is reliant on some of the functionality of NumPy therefore its use requires the installation of NumPy. Numpy is therefore listed as a Matplotlib dependency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python package that is similar to NumPy but is built on top of it. It extends upon Numpy by introducing structures for \"labeled\" or \"relational\" data (e.g. instead of just columns and rows in multidimensional arrays, each column/ row can  be labeled). The main structures that allow this representation of data are \"Series\" and \"DataFrame\"s (similar to R \"data.frame\"). Data in real time are commonly represented in structures similar to Pandas structures and this allows users to use tools in Pandas to extract data from a range of sources e.g. Excel and SQL databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of Pandas capabilities include handling of missing data, easy conversion of external data into Pandas data structures, data subsetting and more.\n",

It uses NumPy data structures to make the performance of scientific computations efficient and quick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is established on a number of python packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SymPy and more. For this reason it is often referred to as an ecosystem for scientific computing as often the use of a combination of these packages is required for a problem to be solved.\n",

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "
